# BalanceScale

This project is an attempt to clone one of the games in the Alice in Borderland series. 

In this game, complexity is the key: players have three minutes to choose a number between 0 and 100. Once this choice has been made, the game system takes all the numbers chosen, adds them up and obtains an average, which is multiplied by 0.8. Whoever chooses the number closest to the final result wins the round. If you're not the winner, you lose one or more points, and that's where it gets scary.
